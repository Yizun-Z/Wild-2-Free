                <p>We clean up a lot of poop! It’s not very glamourous. We wash and sterilise a lot of bottles and
                    teats. We do around 20 loads of washing a week. We spend at least an hour a day collecting fresh
                    branches, dirt and grass for the younger ones to enjoy in the evenings. We also spend several hours
                    a day in the bushier areas of the property, teaching our youngest joeys about the land and helping
                    them develop their confidence and strength. Of course, there’s all the bottle feeds as well. When a
                    joey first comes in, he or she is often on 6-7 feeds a day around the clock. This reduces slowly
                    until they’re down to 4 feeds a day at around 10 months old. They remain on 4 feeds for quite some
                    time before being slowly weaned off altogether at around 18 months old. We won’t say no to an animal
                    in need. We don’t just accept healthy animals to care for. We will take in the sick, the broken, the
                    injured. We will go the extra distance to give them a chance at a normal life. (Wild 2 Free, 2020)

                <p>On NYE 2019, the property was destroyed in the Black Summer Bushfire. The house/kangaroo sanctuary,
                    outbuildings, the car, machinery and every single tree was burnt. Rae and volunteer Karen were
                    rescued on a boat by Rae’s neighbour Simon, an RFS volunteer who had already lost his own property.
                    A damaged cabin and a shipping container full of animal feed survived, providing Simon the basic
                    needs to keep the animals alive, until Rae returned 5 days later. Since Jan 5 2020, Rae has been
                    living in the cabin, providing support and care to the survivors. Thankfully only one fire victim
                    was euthanised by a vet, all other burn victims have since recovered. Now it’s time to rebuild and
                    continue to provide a home for wildlife and other animals in need. Wild 2 Free became a registered
                    charity in April 2017. (Wild 2 Free, 2020)</p>

                <p>Wild 2 Free was established in late 2016 by co-founders Rae Harvey & Sayo Prentic. We had searched
                    all over the east coast of Australia to find a suitable location and property to help animals in
                    need. After an 18 month search we found that at an 850 acre property near Cobargo on the Far South
                    Coast. The property was perfectly set up to house native and farm animals in need, with stables,
                    penned areas and a lot of outbuildings. Unfortunately, fire destroyed our home 3 days after we moved
                    in – we got out moments before it was completely engulfed in flames. We were forced to relocate
                    again, further north to the Mid South Coast to a smaller 67 acres still suitable to release
                    wildlife. This area has grown with the take down of fences with neighbours, the wildlife now free to
                    roam beyond and into the Mogo State Forest. In 2019, Sayo & Rae split up and Rae has been running
                    Wild 2 Free with the help of volunteers ever since. (Wild 2 Free, 2020)</p>
